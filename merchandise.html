Farscape Seasons 1 through 4 on DVD
Farscape is genre television at its most ambitious, inspired both by the cult appeal of Babylon 5 and the continuing success of the Star Trek franchise, but taking a visual and conceptual leap beyond those shows. Making extensive use of CGI, prosthetics, and state-of-the-art puppetry, courtesy of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, the Farscape concept has a freshness that makes it look and feel completely original. Relive the excitement on DVD! Seasons one through four are available now!

The Peacekeeper Wars on DVD
Created at least in part due to popular demand, Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars provides some closure to fans who were dismayed by the demise of the popular science fiction television show in 2003 and campaigned mightily to bring it back. With a 30-minute "making of" documentary among the DVD special features, The Peacekeeper Wars miniseries is a fitting way to end the Farscape saga.
